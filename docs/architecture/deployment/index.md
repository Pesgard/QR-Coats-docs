# Deployment Architecture

This section provides information about how the QRcoats system is deployed and the infrastructure that supports it.

## Deployment Overview

The QRcoats system follows a microservices architecture with separate deployment for each service:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Frontend Services"
        Admin[Admin Panel]
        SuperAdmin[SuperAdmin Panel]
        Customers[Customers App]
        Employees[Employees App]
    end
    
    subgraph "API Services"
        Auth[API Auth]
        EmpAPI[API Employees]
        QR[QR API]
    end
    
    subgraph "Database Tier"
        AuthDB[(Auth DB)]
        EmpDB[(Employees DB)]
        QRDB[(QR DB)]
    end
    
    Admin --> Auth
    SuperAdmin --> Auth
    Customers --> Auth
    Employees --> Auth
    
    Auth --> AuthDB
    Auth --> QR
    Auth --> EmpAPI
    
    EmpAPI --> EmpDB
    QR --> QRDB
```
