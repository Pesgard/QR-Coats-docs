# Data Flow

This section explains how data flows between different components in the QRcoats system.

## Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend as Frontend App
    participant Auth as API Auth
    participant API as Other APIs
    User->>Frontend: Login Request
    Frontend->>Auth: Authentication Request
    Auth->>Auth: Validate Credentials
    Auth->>Frontend: JWT Token
    Frontend->>API: API Request with JWT
    API->>Auth: Validate Token
    Auth->>API: Token Validation Result
    API->>Frontend: API Response
```

## QR Code Generation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend as Frontend App
    participant Auth as API Auth
    participant QR as QR API
    User->>Frontend: Request QR Code
    Frontend->>Auth: Authenticate
    Auth->>Frontend: JWT Token
    Frontend->>QR: Generate QR Code Request
    QR->>QR: Create QR Code
    QR->>QR: Store QR Code Data
    QR->>Frontend: QR Code Response
    Frontend->>User: Display QR Code
```

## Employee Management Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin
    participant AdminApp as Admin Panel
    participant Auth as API Auth
    participant EmpAPI as API Employees
    Admin->>AdminApp: Manage Employee
    AdminApp->>Auth: Authenticate
    Auth->>AdminApp: JWT Token
    AdminApp->>EmpAPI: Employee Management Request
    EmpAPI->>EmpAPI: Process Request
    EmpAPI->>AdminApp: Response
    AdminApp->>Admin: Display Result
```

## Data Storage

Data is stored in different databases depending on the service:

- **Auth Service**: User accounts, permissions, and tokens
- **Employees Service**: Employee data, tasks, and performance metrics
- **QR API Service**: QR code data, scan history, and analytics

## Data Synchronization

[Details about how data is synchronized between services]

## Security Considerations

- All data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- JWT tokens have short expiration times
- Role-based access control limits data access
